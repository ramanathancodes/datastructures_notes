DataStrcutures are the basic elements from which large & complex Software Projects are built.

To understand datastructures , its essential to learn 
	1. how the information is arranged in memory of the computer 
	2. algorithms for manipulating information contained in data structure
	3. perf characteristics of datastructures ,so suitable data structure for particular application can be chosen.

datastructures and algorithms are the important aspects of computer science as they form the fundamental blocks of developing logical solutions to problems.
and writing programs that permorm tasks "OPTIMALLY"
